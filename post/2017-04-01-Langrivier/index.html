<p><em>This analysis was prepared by the <a href="http://www.saeon-fynbos.org"><strong>Fynbos Node</strong></a> of <a href="http://www.saeon.ac.za">the <strong>South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)</strong></a>.</em></p>
<p>Here we present the record of stream flow rates for the Langrivier catchment and rainfall from the Dwarsberg weather station in the Jonkershoek Valley for the period January 1961 to the end of July 2017. The Dwarsberg weather station is at 1214 metres above sea level on the boundary of the catchments of the Eerste, Berg and Sonderend rivers and is a good indicator of rainfall feeding the Berg and Theewaterskloof dams.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We plan to update this page monthly. For live weather data and the record over the past month please access the <a href="http://lognet.saeon.ac.za:8088/Dwarsberg/index.html"><strong>Dwarsberg weather station directly</strong></a>. You may also be interested in our <a href="http://lognet.saeon.ac.za:8088/Constantiaberg/index.html"><strong>Constantiaberg weather station</strong></a> on the Cape Peninsula or our <a href="http://lognet.saeon.ac.za:8088/EngCed/index.html"><strong>Engelsmanskloof weather station</strong></a> in the Cederberg.</p>

<p><em>PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee that these data or analyses are error free, particularly with regards to the older historical data and the comparability of the older and newer instrumentation. Gaps in the data were filled using linear interpolation from the most recent data for up to a 30 day period. This filled all gaps other than the period August 2008 to September 2011 - these data exist in hardcopy, but are still being digitized. There are much better gap-filling techniques, but the appropriate method depends on the question being asked.</em></p>

<h2>Streamflow record</h2>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT JULY’S STREAMFLOW IS YET TO BE ADDED! PLEASE BEAR WITH US…</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Here are the recent monthly streamflow values for Langrivier relative to averages across the entire time period (1961 to current).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017-04-01-Langrivier_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Black error bars around the mean (grey column) indicate 95% confidence intervals. Monthly values lower than the lower bar are among the lowest 5% of recorded flows for that month. January, February, March and May 2017 are the lowest streamflows ever recorded for their respective months. Note that missing months (e.g. October-November 2015) are those that overlap a data gap of over 30 days.</p>
<hr />
<p>We can also view this cumulatively:</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/post/2017-04-01-Langrivier_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Or compare across all years on record:</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/post/2017-04-01-Langrivier_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Note that “Summer” denotes the Austral summer (here defined as October - March), overlapping 2 years. In this figure we have lumped summers by the preceding year, e.g. summer 2016 represents the period October 2016 to March 2017, which incidentally has been the driest summer on record in terms of both streamflow and rainfall.</p>
<p>*Data for October - December from the summer of 2015/2016 are missing due to vandalism of the weir, but January - March 2016 was among the lowest 10% of flows for that period, suggesting that 2015 was likely the driest year on record. Of those with complete data, 2003 was the driest year, followed by 1974.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following dynamic figures illustrate the mean monthly stream flow. You can hover over a piece of the time series to get the date and streamflow value, and adjust and zoom the window of interest by sliding the toggles in the bar at the bottom of each figure. Note the historical data (pre September 2011) has been infilled previously, but we still need to ascertain where the gaps were and what method was used.</p>

<h2>Streamflow ~ Rainfall</h2>
<hr />
<p>There have been various calls for some sort of indication as to how streamflow responds to rainfall. We all want to know how much it needs to rain to fill the dams. While we don’t have a fully coupled atmosphere-hydrological model on hand, and we’re still reading up on the most appropriate time-series modelling approach (especially considering the data gaps…), here’re some quick and dirty indicators based on the periods of overlapping streamflow and rainfall data (1961 - 1991, 2013 - 2016).</p>
<p>Firstly, cumulative monthly streamflow as a function of monthly rainfall:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017-04-01-Langrivier_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While it looks messy, one clear pattern is that a rainfall event in a winter month typically results in greater streamflow than a similar sized event in a summer month. This is especially evident if you compare large rainfall events in late summer/autumn (March, April, May) with those in winter (June, July, August). This is not surprising and likely a result of accumulated soil moisture (or lack thereof) throughout the season, while lower evapotranspiration in winter may also be coming into play.</p>
<p>What does this look like if we aggregate months by season (following the Summer = October to March, Winter = April - September approach from above).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/post/2017-04-01-Langrivier_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>A clear role for accumulated soil moisture throughout the season. Note that the lowest blue point was the winter of 2015. Interestingly the winter of 2016 had the next lowest rainfall, but higher streamflow than a few winters with higher rainfall. This could just be spatial variability in rainfall in the catchment, or the censoring created by our summer/winter divide. Ideally we’d look at different accumulation lags - 30, 60, 90 days etc, but we’ll need to do some reading about the best way to do this. It seems like a good job for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet"><strong>Wavelet analysis</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We’ll need to think a bit more about all this, and especially how to look at evapotranspiration for inclusion in later updates. Feel free to post comments/suggestions below!</p>
