        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e-a3jUSu1Y"><strong>“This is not a (blog post), it’s an outburst”</strong></a> - or rather, it’s supporting online material for an article I wrote for The Daily Maverick highlighting that the City’s draft budget for 2018/19 makes no indication of any investment in alien clearing to relieve the impacts of the current drought. I encourage all Capetonians to <a href="http://www.capetown.gov.za/City-Connect/Have-your-say/Issues-open-for-public-comment/comment-on-the-draft-budget-for-2018-2019"><strong>provide formal comment to the City</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/meet-the-city/city-council/Find-your-councillor-ward-or-subcouncil"><strong>write to your ward councillor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Below is what I wrote. Feel free to copy/borrow from it, use your own words, or remove parts you don’t agree with as you see fit.</p>
<p>You’ll notice there are 3 sections. I pasted the same text into my “Comment on the draft budget” and my “Comment on the proposed amendments to the IDP”. Many may not agree with my “Comment on the draft tariffs”, but I don’t think it detracts from the validity of my argument in the other sections.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Comment on the draft budget/Comment on the proposed amendments to the IDP:</strong></p>
<p><em>To the Major and Council of the City of Cape Town</em></p>
<p><em>Copy to: Councillor Limberg, Councillor van Der Merwe, Dr Gisela Kaiser (Executive Director: Informal Settlements; Water and Waste Services; and Energy), Mr Lungelo Mbandazayo (City Manager)</em></p>
<p><em>The draft budget earmarks &gt;R1.5 million (~17% of the total budget) for bulk water augmentation schemes, but makes no provision for big investment in clearing invasive alien trees from the catchments that feed our dams. There is good scientific evidence that alien trees are reducing water supply to our dams by almost as much as the City’s ±150MLD bulk water augmentation target and will only become much worse if not addressed. There are similar impacts on groundwater, but these are yet to be quantified.</em></p>
<p><em>These impacts are compromising the efficiency of existing bulk water infrastructure and will have similar impacts on augmentation schemes based on groundwater. Estimates are that clearing alien trees and restoring out catchments is cheaper and less environmentally risky than other augmentation options. It is the obvious essential first step required in any water security programme and failure to include substantial investment in catchment restoration in the City’s budget and integrated development plan would be putting the City and its residents at unnecessary risk. By creating dependence on groundwater without addressing threats to surface and groundwater resources the City is reducing its resilience to water scarcity and will be exposing residents to greater risk and potential for a much bigger disaster when the next drought occurs.</em></p>
<p><em>The municipality is legally bound to explore the most cost-effective means of service delivery and to pursue climate resilient paths to adaptation and planning. Improving the natural runoff and recharge in our catchments through restoration is likely to be much less expensive than desalination, is easily on par or cheaper than TMG aquifer borehole drilling, and is fundamentally more sustainable and resilient than either.</em></p>
<p><em>The law also requires anyone who is intending to harm the environment (by, for instance, developing well fields in sensitive wetlands for groundwater abstraction) to first do all they can to avoid the impacts, or minimise and remedy the damage as far as possible. It is hard to see how budgeting only for drilling, and not for rehabilitating catchments to improve recharge is compatible with this “duty of care”.</em></p>
<p><em>The City cannot afford to not invest at least R150 million (~10% of the funds budgeted for groundwater development) into alien clearing and catchment restoration – over and above existing contributions from the expanded public works programmes and others. This would be a very sound investment as it provides multiple benefits beyond improving catchment water yields to dams and groundwater recharge. Alien clearing and restoration improves water quality, biodiversity conservation and ecotourism, while reducing flood and fire risk, erosion and dam siltation. Perhaps most pertinently, investment in a large rehabilitation programme and the associated employment would provide some respite for many farm workers and their families in light of the &gt;33,000 job losses caused by the drought so far.</em></p>
<p><em>While implementing catchment restoration at this scale will have its difficulties, they are no more complex or intractable as those being faced by other bulk water augmentation options.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em>Jasper Slingsby</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Comment on the draft tariffs:</strong></p>
<p><em>While these are steep tariff increases, it is clear that the City has been subsidising water from other income streams and shielding users from the true cost for some time.</em></p>
<p><em>I personally have no complaints about paying the true cost of water, provided that the funds accrued by the City are used wisely and in a way that puts social and environmental fairness ahead of economic efficiency.</em></p>
<p><em>By this I mean that the funds we pay must be used for interventions like restoration or rehabilitation of ecological infrastructure to improve the ability of the natural environment to provide water before engineering solutions are sought.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, the City should seek to avoid strategies that depend on selling water to users to fund infrastructure development. This system begets perverse incentives that almost inevitably result in impacts external to economic considerations that are negative to the environment</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to <a href="https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/meet-the-city/city-council/Find-your-councillor-ward-or-subcouncil"><strong>send it to your ward councillor too</strong></a>.</p>
